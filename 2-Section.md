#### check whether a number is even or odd
2 - Write a function to check whether a number is even or odd


##### Calculate the square root of a number
3 - Write a function that accepts a number and returns its square root. The output can be rounded


#### Return the quotient and remainder
4 - White a function that accepts two integers num1 and num2. The function should divide num1 by num2 and return the quotient and remainder.
The output can be rounded to 2 decimal places


#### Determine the factors of a number

6 - White a function to find power of any number x ^ y


#### Return the decimal part of a number
7 - Write a function that returns the decimal part of a number. The output can be rounded to 2 decimal places.
If decimal part is zero, the function should return the string: INTEGER


#### FzzBuzz Program
8 - Write a function that takes a number as an argument and returns “Fizz”, “Buzz” or “FizzBuzz”. If the number is a multiple of 3, the function should return ”Fizz”. If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5 return “FizzBuzz”. If the number is not a multiple of either 3 or 5, return the number itself.

#### Calculate the number of numerical digits in a String
9 - Write a function that calculates the number of numerical digits in a string
*Example*:
- input_string = “cool6544”
- Expected output = 4


#### Check if a number is equal to the sum of its positive divisors, except itself
10 - Write a  function that accepts a random number and checks if number is equal to the sum of its positive divisor, except itself
input = 28
Expected output = True


#### Check if the given year, month has the Friday 13th
11 - Write a function that accepts two arguments year and month, and then checks if month has Friday 13th.

*Example*:
- year = 2020, month = 3
- expected = True


#### Return the next number greater than the two numbers A & B and divisible by B
12 - Give two numbers A and B. create a function that returns the next number greater than A and B and divisible by. (a > b)


#### Check if the given year, month has the Friday 13th
13 - Write a function that accepts two arguments year and month, and then checks if month has Friday 13th.


#### Boolean values 
14 - Write a Python function that accepts three boolean variables - x,y and z.
The function should return True if at least two out of three variables are True.


Examples:

x = True, y = False, z = True
Expected = True


#### Factorial of a number
15 - Write a python function that randomly chooses any number from 1 to 10 and then calculates the factorial of the number

Example:
num = 5
factorial = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 *1 = 120


#### Check if a function returns a whole number without decimals after dividing
16 - Check if a function returns a whole number without decimals after dividing

Examples:

check_division (4 / 2) => True
check_division (25 / 4) => False

#### Prime number
17 - Write a function that accepts a number and returns True if the number is a prime number else returns False. A prime number is an integer which cannot be divided evenly by any integer except 1 and itself. 
you may assume that n is a non-negative integer.


#### Sum of digits in a integer
18 - Write a function that randomly chooses any number “n” from 100 to 300 and then calculates the sum of the digits in the number.

*Example:*
n = 156
total = 12


#### Return the numbers divisible by 15 in a list
19 - Write a function that generates a list named “input_list” containing 10 random numbers ranging from 0-100,
and then the function should return a list of numbers divisible by fifteen from the “input_list”
